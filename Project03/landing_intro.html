        <h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
        <p>This thesis suggests rethinking domesticity at the juncture of architectureâ€™s entanglements with settler colonialism in a diasporic world. Spectators to their disappearance and destruction, three dislocated spaces of dwelling begin to re-emerge as apertures to subversive futures. Through collage as it is complemented by narrative, multiple potentialities within this imagined junkspace unfold. <br><br> The process of making collage is dominated by dualities actively blurring, romanticizing and questioning this discourse. Both mediative and reflective, the intentional or not, choice of material included or excluded through this medium, allows for a degree of subjectivity and ambiguity to surface regardless of graphic clarity. The space of dwelling and subsequent waste become the by-products of collectivity displaying collected artefacts* and curating possessions.<br><br>A series of seemingly disparate scenes begin to depict inherent dichotomies of home from the outside looking in-between and not yet inside, or from the inside looking beyond and never within. Existing in the space between memory and material, this thesis is a non-hierarchical, anti-formal experimentation on scenes of the ordinary as conceptual linkages between the imagined or possible, and the real or existing. <br> <br> <br> <br><strong>*of MEMORY and MATERIAL</strong>
